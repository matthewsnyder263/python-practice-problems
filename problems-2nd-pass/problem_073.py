# Write a class that meets these requirements.
#
# Name:       Student
#
# Required state:
#    * name, a string
#
# Behavior:
#    * add_score(score)   # Adds a score to their list of scores
#    * get_average()      # Gets the average of the student's scores
#
# Example:
#    student = Student("Malik")

#    student.add_score(80)
#    print(student.get_average())    # Prints 80
#    student.add_score(90)
#    student.add_score(82)
#    print(student.get_average())    # Prints 84
#
# Do it without pseudocode, this time, from memory. Don't look
# at the last one you just wrote unless you really must.
